Development exercise for application

## Running Project

- To run the project locally, use `npm run start`, which just starts the local webpack-dev-server on port 8080
- To just see the final result, open the `index.html` file


## Comments
- Input design looks very similar to cards
- The 'Enter' action seems like a wierd label. Maybe 'Save'?
